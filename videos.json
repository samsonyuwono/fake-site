  "description": "ABOUT THE FILM<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMaryam Henderson-Uloho spent thirteen years in prison in Louisiana, seven in solitary confinement. After her release she struggled to find housing or employment. She began selling secondhand goods out of a suitcase on a street corner in New Orleans. In just three years, she grew her business to a brick-and-mortar thrift store\u2014one that also provides housing and employment for other formerly-incarcerated women. She calls those women\u2014and her store\u2014Sister Hearts. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n---<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cWhen I got out of prison, they wouldn't allow me to open a bank account. I could not rent an apartment. I could not get a job. So I started just selling stuff out of a suitcase on the street corner. The first day I made $40. And I just kept doing that. Three years later, I have a 15,000 square foot thrift store and transition housing facility for other female ex-offenders.\u201d <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Maryam Henderson-Uloho, owner of SisterHearts Thrift Store, New Orleans",

  "description": "One of the most powerful films I\u2019ve seen as a young boy is one most people have never heard of. Cryptically titled \u2018Koyaanisqatsi\u2019, this unique film employed only fantastically executed visuals backed by a hypnotic, dramatic music score to tell a story. It was a strange, experimental film, too hard to describe with words, but I was completely mesmerized by it. There was no (obvious) plot to follow, it had no actors or songs, but despite this, \u2018Koyaanisqatsi\u2019 was one incredibly immersive experience. Some of the most unique aspects of this film were its groundbreaking time lapse sequences. I was still very young and could not understand how they were filmed, but I do remember the impact they left on my impressionable mind.<br \/>\r\nMany years have passed since then and I\u2019ve chosen to pursue the art of photography and filmmaking as my career, of which time lapse cinematography takes its biggest share. I don\u2019t know if this is a blessing or a curse, because shooting, processing and time lapse films take an immense amount of effort and patience, a fact unknown to most. But seeing the finished product, after all that hard work, still fill me with immeasurable joy and satisfaction. This motivates me to keep on learning in order to get better at the craft.<br \/>\r\n\u2018Elysium\u2019 features the skylines of Dubai and Abu Dhabi which are among the most imposing and photogenic ones in the world. The quiet giants, soaring high into the Emirati skies are a source of awe and inspiration for any dreamer or photographer. What gives this film a dreamlike quality however is the elusive winter fog and its mysterious interaction with the tallest structures. Viewed from a high angle, the fog turns the cities into a grand canvas of visual poetry which could only be expressed with a language of time lapse cinematography.<br \/>\r\nThe fog\u2019s formation is very hard to predict and therefore, it\u2019s not easy to film. I was forced to spend many sleepless nights chasing the foggy conditions from various rooftops across the UAE. When the fog finally formed, and all elements came together, it was like witnessing magic. Watching the fog as it rolled between and over the buildings was such a haunting and utterly fascinating sight. It was a quite a logistical and technical challenge to capture all scenes I needed for a film, but it was all worth it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nVarious scenes of \u2018Elysium\u2019 were captured in Dubai and Abu Dhabi between 2013 and 2017.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMusic score: 'Bayt Lahm' by Ryan Taubert",
